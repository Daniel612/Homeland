A  3D earth-moon system for WWDC17 Scholarship Application (Accepted)

**WWDC17 Scholarship Requirment**

> Create an interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Be creative. You can use [Swift Playgrounds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492?mt=8) on iPad or [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12) on macOS. If you need inspiration, use templates in Swift Playgrounds for a head start on more advanced creations. Make them your own by adding graphics, audio, and more.

## Overview

This playground uses **SceneKit** to create a Earth Moon system. It is our beautiful homeland, as shown in the following figure. The "Mother Earth" refreshes my memory of coding first "Hello World". The scene will start with a cool opening animation. 

> Because the playground was built in March, 2017, it maybe not run well in the lastest Xcode. It is recommended run in the Xcode 8.2.1 to get the best experience.

## Installation

1. Install `Xcode 8.2.1` on your macOS.
2. Open `Homeland.playground`.
3. Show the Assistant editor and choose live view.
4. Interact with the scene and have fun!
